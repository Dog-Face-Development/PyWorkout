# PyWorkout
A simple commmand line application to keep me inspired during my workout! Tracks workout activities, provides statistics and plays videos. 

## Usage
Make sure you have the [Python Interpreter](https://www.python.org/) installed. 

To run the app, double click on the `main.py` file to launch the command line interface (CLI), or the `gui.py` file to launch the GUI. The CLI has more features at this time, but by the end of development they will both be on par.
