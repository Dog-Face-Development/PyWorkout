# PyWorkout Customization 

PyWorkout has been designed to be heavily customizable. More workouts can be added, lengths can be changed, and videos can be used from different sources.

All of these instructions require [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [a text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to be installed. 

## Add a Muscle Group 

To add a muscle group to PyWorkout, many things must be changed - however, do not fear, as the framework for these things is already there. 

## Change the Number of Sets or Reps

Changing the number of sets or reps of a workout is extrememly easy!

## Change the Videos

Changing the video address is extremely easy as well! I reccomend workout videos by [Pamela Reif](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChVRfsT_ASBZk10o0An7Ucg).
